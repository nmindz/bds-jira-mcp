# Demo JIRA Workflow

Demonstrates the complete JIRA-to-Git workflow using a sample ticket.

## Steps:
1. Check if JIRA configuration is set up
2. Prompt for a JIRA ticket ID (e.g., PROJ-123)
3. Fetch and display the ticket details
4. Generate a conventional commit message based on the ticket
5. Create a feature branch with sanitized naming
6. Show the generated branch name and commit message
7. Optionally post a comment to the JIRA ticket about the branch creation

## Usage:
Use this command to see the complete workflow in action or to test that all integrations are working properly with a real JIRA ticket.
